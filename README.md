## Important Notes, Suggestions and Recommendations

It is extremely important that we carry out tests on our code and applications on the front end side, no matter what technology we use, if we want to improve our code and make it more secure and reliable, we must implement tests that ensure a high percentage that we are doing things right.

The tests allow us to better understand the business logic and therefore make our code more intelligent and optimized.
